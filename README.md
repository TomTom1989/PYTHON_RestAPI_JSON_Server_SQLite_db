This repository contains two projects for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using Python. These projects highlight skills in database management, RESTful API interaction, and user input validation.

1) Task Manager with SQLite: A command-line application for managing a task list, leveraging SQLite for persistent data storage (View Tasks/Add Tasks/Update Task priority/Delete Task/Data validation)

2) Vintage Cars Database: This project demonstrates how to set up and use a simple JSON Server as a backend for managing a database of vintage cars. The application supports CRUD operations (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) through HTTP requests, and changes can be monitored in real-time via the `http://localhost:3000/cars` endpoint.
PS: The JSON Server should run (with nodeJS and NPM installed) on powerShell
